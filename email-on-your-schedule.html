              <p>If you give your email inbox unlimited access to your focus, it will never leave you alone. I limit this by having my email delivered to my inbox only at certain times of the day.</p>
<p>There are paid services that will do this for you &#8212; I started out by using Inbox Pause by Boomerang. Originally, this was included in the free service, but now you have to pay to have your email delivered on a set schedule. (You can still pause your inbox indefinitely or for a set amount of time, but you have to go back and manually turn the feature back on.)</p>
<p>If you use gmail, you can follow these steps to hack together a Google Apps script that will deliver your email at the times you have set aside to deal with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a gmail filter that will divert all incoming mail from your inbox. Go to settings&gt;filters, and create a new filter. In the &#8220;From:&#8221; field, type &#8220;*&#8221;, and in the &#8220;Has the words:&#8221; field, type &#8220;label:inbox&#8221;. (Don&#8217;t include the quotes in either.) It should look like this:<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-222" src="assets/legacy/2019/01/gmailfilter.jpeg" alt="gmailfilter"   /></li>
<li>Click continue. Gmail will scold you, warning that this filter won&#8217;t work, but it works in my experience.</li>
<li>The next page will ask what action the filter should perform. Check &#8220;Skip the Inbox (Archive it)&#8221; and &#8220;Apply the Label: Paused&#8221; (that&#8217;s what I named my label, and what my Google Apps script refers to).<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="assets/legacy/2019/01/gmailfilter2.jpeg" alt="gmail filter 2.jpeg"   /></li>
<li>Go to Google Apps scripts and create a new script. The script is as follows:<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="assets/legacy/2019/01/unpausescript.jpeg" alt="unpausescript"   /></li>
<li>Click the clock icon to set the triggers for this script. Select time-based triggers and choose the time of day that works best for you. I choose to deliver three times per day: once during my commute so that I see them when I get to my office, once after my morning classes are done, and once before I leave for the day. You can choose different times for different days of the week, but it takes a bit longer to set up.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several benefits to this setup. It allows you to batch email-related tasks to a few times per day, clearing up the rest of your schedule. You still have the ability to send email. If there&#8217;s a thread that you want to see replies to immediately, you can just leave that thread in your inbox and the reply will show up. Finally, you can always &#8220;cheat the system&#8221; by looking at the unread count on your &#8220;Paused&#8221; label. This was particularly tempting during my job search, but I usually found some annoying email that I didn&#8217;t want to deal with, instead of exciting job news.</p>
<p>Let me know if you try this, or have any interesting tweaks to the system.</p>

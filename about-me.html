<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana. I attended Xavier University in Cincinnati, where I earned a BS in Physics and Mathematics.</p>
<p>I earned my PhD in Physics from the University of Minnesota in 2014, studying nuclear theory with my adviser Joe Kapusta. During my PhD studies, I was a Doctoral Dissertation Fellow and a <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/">Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Fellow.</a></p>
<p>In my spare time, I play basketball, ride my bicycle, and kayak. I coached a Minneapolis Parks youth basketball team for three years.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling">bicycling Eddington number</a> is 26 as of October 19, 2019. I have completed two century rides with friends, and I hope to complete both days of the next Hilly Hundred (I did one day in 2019, but there was too much rain the other day).</p>
<p>I was interviewed for <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/every-little-thing/celebrity-crush-bill-nye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this podcast</a> about my experience viewing the Great American Eclipse in 2017. I provided an audio recording that I took while watching the eclipse, one snippet of which made the episode.</p>
<p>I was interviewed for <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/37837-donnie-darko-pseudoscience-physicists-explain">this article</a> about the physics of the movie Donnie Darko, and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/42268-who-was-stephen-hawking-to-the-scientific-community-researchers-explain-his-impact">this article</a> about Stephen Hawking&#8217;s impact on physics.</p>
<h3>My preferred equipment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://evernote.com/products/scannable/">Scannable</a> app is extremely useful for sharing handwritten notes with students and collaborators, and archiving them on Evernote</li>
<li>My bike is a <a href="http://www.bianchiusa.com/archives/sportiva/turismo/iseo/">Bianchi Iseo</a></li>
<li>I&#8217;m often seen wearing an <a href="http://lf.hatworld.com/hwl?set=sku%5B20213245%5D,c%5B2%5D,w%5B500%5D,h%5B375%5D&amp;load=url%5Bfile:product%5D">Albuquerque Isotopes hat</a> to represent Nuclear Physics, though I have yet to visit New Mexico</li>

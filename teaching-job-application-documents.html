              <p>There are a lot of sources of advice for job application documents. I relied largely on Karen Kelsky&#8217;s site and book, both called The Professor Is In. Two things that are lacking in these resources are STEM-specific advice and examples of real, successful job documents. I am sharing mine here, along with some comments.</p>
<p>This year (2017-2018) was my third year on the tenure-track job market, and by far my most successful. I applied for 33 TT jobs, did 16 Skype or phone interviews, and did 5 campus visits. I received and accepted a job offer from Indiana State University. The jobs were a diverse range of teaching-focused departments, including liberal arts and teaching-focused public schools. I visited two Baptist-affiliated schools, one Catholic school, and two public universities.</p>
<p>Here is my <a title="CV 2017 Bartz" href="assets/legacy/2018/04/cv-2017-bartz.pdf">Curriculum Vitae as of Spring 2018</a>. I did not modify this between applications, except as updates were warranted.</p>
<p>My <a title="Bartz ISU Letter" href="assets/legacy/2018/04/bartz-isu-letter.pdf">Cover Letter</a> was written mostly following Karen Kelsky&#8217;s suggested template. The main change that I made from her suggestions was to put my teaching paragraph before my research paragraphs. This was my biggest change from my previous years of applications, and I had much more success in the 2017-2018 application season. I think this is a major difference between STEM fields (physics in particular) compared to the humanities and social sciences &#8212; the R1 career track is completely different from the teaching-focused track. Putting research first in your letter may signal to search committees that you want a position where you can put research first.</p>
<p>I kept my <a title="Teaching Statement 2017" href="assets/legacy/2018/04/teaching-statement-2017.pdf">Teaching Statement</a> to one page, unless the job ad requested something longer (one of the jobs I interviewed for asked for two pages, and I was able to expand this statement a bit by including paragraphs I had trimmed from previous years). I modified this a bit based on what kind of class sizes the schools offered, and if the school has a physics major or not.</p>
<p>My <a title="Research Statement 2017" href="assets/legacy/2018/04/research-statement-2017.pdf">Research Statement</a> didn&#8217;t change much between applications, except when schools had particularly quirky requests in the job ad, or for the few places I applied that offer a master&#8217;s degree in physics.</p>

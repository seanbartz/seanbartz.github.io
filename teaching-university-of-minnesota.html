<p>I was a teaching assistant for a variety of courses at the University of Minnesota during my graduate education. As a TA, I led laboratory and collaborative problem solving sessions using interactive learning techniques.</p>
<p>I was the primary instructor on technical writing skills for the laboratory reports of the students in my sections. Along with grading exams, I provided feedback on the written lab reports. I also organized and scheduled grading and proctoring duties for TAs.</p>

<span style="color:#ffffff;"> Outstanding TA Award, University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy, 2009</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">“Sean is always kind and willing to answer questions without making you feel dumb. He has a good rapport with students and is <b>able to put reasonably complex concepts into approachable, non-intimidating terms.</b> He never tries to show off how much he knows.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">“He made the subject matter clear and concise. As well he related it to what we were working on and was always willing to help us when we had questions. The best thing was that he <b>answered our questions with a question that led us in the right direction.</b>”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">“Was able to teach physics to those who really knew it in the class as well as those of us who couldn’t quite grasp it.”</span></p>
